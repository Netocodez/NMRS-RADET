OpenMRS is an open source software that is used for Electronic documentation of patients information, especially PLHIV in Health Facilities and  it's open source which means that different people make contribution to enhance the system. Hence, itâ€™s no tied to any organization.

Considering the fact that some notable IPs in Nigeria are migrating from lamis to NMRS.
I developed this tool which is used to convert NMRS line list to RADET (Retention and Audit Determination Tool), this will help IPs and organizations that are yet to fully migrate Lamis to NMRS to still do analysis with RADET (Uniform data) until they are fully conversant with NMRS.

When you open the NMRS-RADET.exe, you will see the option to select and convert your NMRS file to Radet.

Your inputs is very important to me and it will go a long way in helping me to improve this software.
